# AutoReceipter // B.A.D. Development
###### Android app project for COP 4331-Spring 2016 at the University of Central Florida

### Build with
* Android Studio 1.5
* Android 6.0

From the Android Studio welcome screen, click "Import Project" and select "build.gradle" from the main project folder. This will open up the project for us. 
If there is an error (unsupported version), then delete your ".idea" folder and resync the project to regenerate the missing files needed.

To build the project, it is recommended to use a real Android device or to use the Android Studio device emulator. To access the developer options on your Android device, go to Settings > About Phone > Build Number and tap until you are a "developer". Access the new developer options from the settings menu and enable USB Debugging. You are ready to start building and debugging straight from your device.
